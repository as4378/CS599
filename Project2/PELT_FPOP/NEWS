2. New utility functions for plotting, printing fits, and simulating according to 
and AR(1) model. 
3. New function estimate_calcium to estimate the calcium concentration after estimate_spikes is run.

Major updates to the package:

1. Updated constrained and unconstrained models for better numerical stability over long periods of no neural activity 

2. Require LZeroSpikeInference as dependency 

3. Remove cross validation utility
